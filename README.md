# Bealover

## About the Project

This project was developed for the **10 Days Project Challenge** competition organized by **Thinc Club at Chulalongkorn University**.

**Bealover** is a fun and light-hearted website where users answer short personality quiz questions through the perspective of an adorable beaver mascot. The goal is to reflect on one's thoughts and attitudes towards love.

After completing all the questions, the website summarizes your chances of finding love and suggests ways to improve your habits to increase those chances.

### Why *Bealover*?

The name *Bealover* comes from combining **Beaver** + **Lover**. The beaver is the mascot of this website because beavers are known for their loyalty â€” they have only one partner at a time. If their partner passes away, a beaver is capable of finding love again.

This symbolizes that we should not cling to past loves but be courageous enough to start anew, just like the beaver. Everyone deserves a chance at love.
